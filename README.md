to earlier versions. The new version is written entirely in Python. Single file executable 
versions of the software for Windows and Mac operating systems can be downloaded from 
https://www.metawinsoft.com, which also contains a copy of the manual/help file.

In addition, the downloadable executables at https://www.metawinsoft.com are built using 
PyInstaller.
